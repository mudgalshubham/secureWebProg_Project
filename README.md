# secureWebProg_Project

A secure web-application designed for academic purpose.

The idea is to build an e-Commerce site for second hand stuff only for CU Boulder students.

Functionality includes:
1) Browsing the current catalog.
2) Sign up for new CU Boulder users.
3) Login for extra functionalities.
4) Add items to sell to catalog.
5) Add reviews/ratings to the seller.
6) Update user profile.

The application incorporates the following (security) features:
1) Require authentication for a subset of features.
2) Use a relational database.
3) Query content from database.
4) Require HTTPS.
5) Prevent from SQLi attacks.
6) Use prepared statements.
7) Prevent from XSS attacks.
8) Sanitize user inputs.
9) Secure use of sessions.
